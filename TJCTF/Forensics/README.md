<h2>Angie's Write-up for fake-geoguesser (227 points)</h2>

<h3>Challenge description</h3>

<p>We don't do guess challs here at TJCTF, so that means no Geoguessr ðŸ˜” Since I took this photo myself, 
though, you can find out precisely where it was taken, and some Bonus Contentâ„¢, from my Camera Model Name 
to the Circle Of Confusion. Maybe you'll find a flag there?</p>

<h2>Steps to get the flag</h2>

<p>First, I downloaded the lake image from the challenge site. Afterwards, I used an online forensics tool called forensically so I can analyze the image. On the fifth line I saw bits of the flag starting with "tfjcf" and knew that it was the first section of the flage. Then I decided to scrool down ever further and saw the last section of the hidden message. The flag was tjctf{thats_a_lot_of_metadata}</p>
